# Topic Modeling
first project - topic modeling on china: statments

one can choose between 4 versions of topic modeling - TF-IDF; LDA; Bert; LDA+Bert.

first stage is scraping, then preprocess, followed by autoencoder (if neccesary), then modeling and output via main.

last commit was splitting a big file into smaller ones orgenized by their roles.

feel free to comment
